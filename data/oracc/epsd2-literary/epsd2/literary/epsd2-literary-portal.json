      "text": "The core of the epsd2/literary corpus is formed by the almost 400 Sumerian compositions edited in  ETCSL  [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk]  (1996-2006) and the almost 500 literary tablets from Ur, published in UET 6, and edited by Jeremiah Peterson for the  Ur Online Project  [http://www.ur-online.org/about/ur-online-project] . These data are supplemented by editions of literary texts that appeared elsewhere, but no systematic effort has been made to include all such material.   As of June 2021 the editions of Sumerian literary debates in the Datenbank Sumerischer Streitliteratur( DSSt  [/dsst]  are indexed in epsd2, but those editions are not duplicated here.
